# Ex1: Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

## Overview
This repository contains a C program designed to encode and decode text files using a Caesar cipher. The program supports both encryption and decryption of text using a specified shift value (key).

## Features
- **Encoding**: Shifts each letter in the text by a specified number of places down the alphabet.
- **Decoding**: Reverses the encoding process by shifting letters back by the specified key.
- **Automated Testing**: Includes tests to validate both encoding and decoding functionalities, especially handling cyclic shifts and edge cases.

# Ex2: Bus Line Sorting System

## Overview
This repository contains a C program designed to sort data of bus lines based on duration, distance, or name. The program supports sorting operations through user commands and validates input data for each bus line before processing.

## Features
- **Sorting by Duration**: Orders bus lines from shortest to longest duration.
- **Sorting by Distance**: Orders bus lines from shortest to longest distance.
- **Sorting by Name**: Alphabetically orders bus lines.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures all input data conforms to expected formats and constraints before sorting.
- **Automated Testing**: Includes tests to validate the sorting functionality for each criterion.

# Ex3: Markov Chain Text Generator

## Overview
This repository contains a C program designed to generate text based on the Markov chain model. The program constructs a Markov chain from input data and uses this model to generate new text sequences that mimic the style and context of the input.

## Features
- **Text Generation**: Generates new text sequences based on the probabilities derived from the input data.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Utilizes linked lists to dynamically manage the Markov nodes and their connections.
- **Random Selection**: Chooses the next word based on weighted probabilities to ensure varied outputs.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that all input data is valid and conforms to expected formats.
